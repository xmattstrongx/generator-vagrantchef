This is a demo template for the project "<?= name ?>" showing some capabilities of ERB. 

This is an interesting example because it involves two layers of templating. As you can see in the [original source](https://github.com/jacobgreenleaf/test/blob/master/cookbooks/test/recipes/default.rb),
the first layer of templating is done when the project is created using [EJS](http://ejs.co/) through [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/authoring/file-system.html). The second layer of 
templating is done when the cookbooks are run at build time or on demand using Chef-Zero. It uses [ERB](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/) (embedded ruby).
